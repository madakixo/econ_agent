"""
Stationarity: ARIMA assumes a stationary series, so differencing (d) is critical. The ADF test guides this process.

AIC: Used to compare models; it penalizes complexity to avoid overfitting.

Forecast Horizon: 30 years is long for ARIMA, which may lead to flat predictions as it relies heavily on historical patterns.
